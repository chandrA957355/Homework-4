'''
This module contains tests for the `perform_calculation_and_display` function
from the main application. It uses the pytest framework to validate the behavior
of various arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication,
and division. The tests also cover edge cases such as invalid inputs and
unknown operations.
